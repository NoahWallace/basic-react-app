## React Sample App

#### Setup

Install nodejs >12.x

on windows I personally like using [Chocolatey](https://vocon-it.com/2019/11/19/install-npm-using-chocolatey-on-windows/)

nodejs comes with npm

open command line and navigate to you code repository

```bash
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

a local development server will launch the application in the browser on localhost:3001


### Note:

if npm is not available in PS or in command line, add it to the environment variables

```
C:\Program Files\nodejs
```
